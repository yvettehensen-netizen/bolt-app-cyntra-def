SELECT sector, COUNT(*) as count
FROM free_quickscan_leads
GROUP BY sector
ORDER BY count DESC;

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Email not sending

**Check:**
1. `RESEND_API_KEY` is set in edge function secrets
2. Email address is valid
3. Check Resend dashboard for errors
4. Fallback to Supabase email (check Supabase logs)

**Fix:**
```sql
-- Check if lead was saved
SELECT * FROM free_quickscan_leads WHERE email = 'test@example.com';
```

### Issue: Analysis fails

**Check:**
1. `OPENAI_API_KEY` is valid (or omit for mock analysis)
2. Check edge function logs
3. Verify input validation

**Fix:**
- Remove OpenAI key to use mock analysis
- Check OpenAI API status

### Issue: No results displayed

**Check:**
1. Browser console for errors
2. Network tab for API response
3. Edge function logs

**Fix:**
```javascript
// Check API response in browser console
const response = await fetch(apiUrl, {...});
console.log(await response.json());
```

## Security Considerations

### Data Privacy
- ✅ Minimal data collection (name, email, sector, challenge)
- ✅ No sensitive information required
- ✅ GDPR-compliant (explicit consent via form submission)
- ✅ Secure storage in Supabase

### Spam Prevention
- ⚠️ No CAPTCHA (consider adding if spam becomes an issue)
- ⚠️ No rate limiting (consider adding per IP/email)
- ✅ Email validation on frontend and backend

### RLS Security
- ✅ Public can read (analytics only)
- ✅ Only service role can insert
- ✅ No update/delete policies (prevent tampering)

---

## Performance

### Edge Function
- Cold start: ~500ms
- Warm: ~200ms
- With OpenAI: +2-3s
- With email: +500ms

### Database
- Insert: <50ms
- Indexes for fast queries
- No complex joins

### Frontend
- Page load: <1s
- Form submission: 2-5s (depending on AI/email)
- Results display: instant

---

## Metrics to Track

### Conversion Funnel
1. Page visits (`/free-scan`)
2. Form starts (name filled)
3. Form completions (submit clicked)
4. Successful analyses
5. Email opens (via Resend)
6. CTA clicks (upgrade to full scan)
7. Account signups (from free leads)

### Lead Quality
- Average score by sector
- Common challenges
- Conversion rate to paid users
- Time to conversion
